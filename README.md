# snake_game
Snake is a game where the player maneuvers a growing line that becomes a primary obstacle to itself. Using object programming and the turtle class I recreated the snake game. Feel free to go through the files and add enhancements to the game. 

This game is played by launching in an IDE that supports Puthon, then attempt to beat your high score by eating as much food as possible. You can control the snake by moving the arrows on your keyboard. Once you hit the border of the screent the game will end. Have fun!
